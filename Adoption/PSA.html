	<h1>Pet Adoption</h1>
	<p>Every year, 6.5 million pets in the U.S. are surrendered to shelters. One of the easiest things you can do is adopting a stray instead of going to a breeder or a pet shop. This not only gives a pet in need a home, but also costs less and reduces the incentives for breeding breeding practices that hurt animals in the long run. In addition, local humane societies often address an animal's medical needs prior to adoption, so they are usually caught up on shots and other requirements. </p>
